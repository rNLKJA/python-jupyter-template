# Issue Guidelines

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. Effective and well-organized issue reporting is crucial to the development process. This document provides guidelines on how to create and manage issues in this repository.

## Creating an Issue

When you encounter a bug, have a feature request, or see an opportunity for improvement, you can create an issue to discuss it. Here's how:

1. Navigate to the 'Issues' tab in the repository.
2. Click 'New issue'.
3. Choose the appropriate issue template if multiple are available.
4. Fill out the template with as much relevant information as possible.

## Assigning Issues

Issues can be assigned to specific team members to indicate who is responsible for working on them.

- **To Assign an Issue**: When creating or editing an issue, you can assign it by typing a team member's username in the 'Assignees' section on the right. 
- **Multiple Assignees**: An issue can be assigned to multiple people if it requires collaboration or if it's a larger task that needs to be divided.

## Labeling Issues

Labels are used to categorize and prioritize work. Here are some common labels and when to use them:

- **`Triage`**: Needs to be reviewed and classified.
- **`Bug`**: Marks the issue as a bug or error that needs to be fixed.
- **`Feature Request`**: Indicates a request for new functionality or a feature.
- **`Documentation`**: Relates to improvements or additions to documentation.
- **`Help Wanted`**: Marks issues where the team is actively seeking external help or contributions.
- **`Good First Issue`**: Identifies issues suitable for first-time contributors.
- **`Priority: High` / `Priority: Low`**: Indicates the urgency or importance of the issue.

### How to Add Labels

1. Open the issue.
2. On the right-hand side, you'll find the 'Labels' section.
3. Click on it and select the appropriate labels for the issue.

## Updating Issues

As work progresses, the issue should be updated to reflect the current state. This includes:

- Adding comments to provide additional information or updates.
- Updating labels if the nature or priority of the issue changes.
- Reassigning the issue if it needs to be transferred to someone else.

## Closing Issues

Once the issue has been resolved, or if it's determined that it won't be addressed, it should be closed. You can close an issue by clicking the 'Close issue' button at the bottom of the issue discussion.

## Conclusion

Well-managed issues contribute significantly to the efficiency and clarity of the project. By following these guidelines, you're helping to maintain the quality and productivity of the development process. Your efforts are greatly appreciated!
