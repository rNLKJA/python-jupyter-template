# Usage Instructions:

1. Create Environment: Use the following command to create an environment from the environment.yml file:

```bash
Copy code
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

2. Activate Environment: Activate the created environment using:


```bash
Copy code
conda activate my-python-env
```

3. Deactivate Environment: When you're done working in the environment, you can deactivate it with:


```bash
Copy code
conda deactivate
```

4. Update Environment: If you update the environment.yml file later, you can update the environment to reflect the changes using:

```bash
Copy code
conda env update --file environment.yml --prune
```
